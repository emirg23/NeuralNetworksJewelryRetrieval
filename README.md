some files are missing because of the size of the file so if you wanna test it, be careful about that please:

ARCFACE:  
- venv folder
- jewelry_dataset but it is in project so you can just copy and paste it

TRIPLETNET:
- venv folder
- jewelry_dataset but it is in project so you can just copy and paste it
- models_output (make train.py work so you can get the trained files)
